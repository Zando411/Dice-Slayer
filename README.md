# Dice-Slayer
Dice Slayer is a simple game about slaying monsters through dice rolls. As you progress through rooms, you get stronger, but so do your opponents. Choose between a story mode with a set amount of rooms, or endless mode with rooms as long as you can survive. How far can you go?

How to play: 
On program start, the player will be given the choice between story mode and endless mode.

# Story mode: 
-Set amount of rooms (to be determined, maybe 5ish) that increase in difficulty every round. 
-Every room contains a monster to fight
-Players will roll dice against the monster, whichever rolls higher wins
-Players and monsters both have health, whoever loses loses one health
-Whichever reaches 0 hp loses the fight. If the player loses, their run is over and they must restart the game. If the monster loses, the player progresses to the next room
-As players progress they will gain unique upgrades that are randomized, making every run different. 
-Game ends either when the player defeats all story mode rooms, or when the player dies.

# Endless Mode:
-Same rules as story mode, but endless! Score is counted based on how many rooms with randomized monsters the player beats
-Game ends when player dies
-Scaling leveling for when player gets upgrades (slay different amounts of monsters the higher in level you go)
-Monsters will be same level as player with their own randomized upgrades, with an added chance of one of their upgrade slots not being filled
-Max level of 10, encourages players to try different ability upgrade combinations and not go on forever without good decisions or good builds

# Upgrades:

-+1 to roll (stacking, 1 becomes 2 etc.)
-+2 to max roll (rolls d8 instead of d6, stacks to d10) 
-+1 max HP (stacking)
-+1 reroll (can reroll the die once for every stack, adds to your previous roll. )
